A simple real time chat app made with React, Material UI and axios.

## How to Run

I've included a .env file in the root directory where you have to put my token and url in order for the app to work. 

Afterwards the code will run with the following steps -

git clone https://github.com/AlexHurrell/WD-ALEX-HURRELL.git

cd WD-ALEX-HURRELL

npm install

npm start
